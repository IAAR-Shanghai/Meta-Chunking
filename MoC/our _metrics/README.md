    MoC: Mixtures of Text Chunking Learners for Retrieval-Augmented Generation System
</h1>


For a more convenient experience and feeling of the two chunking metrics we proposed, we provide codes and chunked data of different chunking methods, which can be downloaded via [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CR3FehGYi6vFZEhcoPJmTDSjuSULKiIo/view?usp=sharing). Their average chunk lengths are the same to ensure the rationality of evaluation.
